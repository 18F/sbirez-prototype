          <h1>Description</h1>
          <p>Global integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (GIISR) is one of the service core functions of the U.S. Air Force. GIISR will provide battlefield information to the warfighter at any weather condition in real-time. Experts believe unauthorized users can hold our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets at risk and force us to operate at sub-optimal standoffs. Further, inexpensive electronic attack systems can limit our ability to collect reliable ISR from mono-static platforms. Hence, to address these onerous technical challenges for contested/anti-access area denial (A2AD) environment, the Air Force must develop affordable, low-cost ISR systems with advanced exploitation capabilities. In general, future ISR systems must be designed so that unauthorized users cannot penetrate to downgrade our ISR capabilities at any critical chain (transmit, receive, and processing) of operation. Our transmit signals must be designed in such a way that an enemy cannot see our presence.</p>
          <p>Recently, researchers have developed theoretical foundation for spread spectrum coded linear frequency modulation (LFM) transmit signal that has potentials for solving some of the above mentioned technical challenges of the contested environment [1-2]. Some of the characteristics of these signals are: (a) inherit properties of direct sequence spread spectrum and LFM waveforms, (b) remain almost orthogonal on both transmit and receive, and (c) can hide while operating in adversaries environments. In addition, when properly processed, two important benefits of these signals are: (a) can provide exploitation capabilities that LFM waveforms exhibit (i.e., Doppler tolerant) and (b) can achieve high resolution imaging capability to separate a weak target that is close to a strong target. Other approaches on waveforms design and exploitations can be found in various literatures [3-5].</p>
          <p>We are seeking sensor technology development to accomplish both (1) transmit signal design and (2) exploitation algorithms for simultaneous SAR and GMTI processing. This technology should advance the state-of-the-art and be effective in the A2AD environment; in particular, our signal should not be corrupted by the other users so as to reduce the effectiveness of the surveillance systems. Operating environment to be focused on is contested region but not limited to other scenarios. Performance measures to include are improved signal to clutter and noise ratio, ultra high resolution to discern a weak target close to a strong target, and shorter time for both SAR and GMTI exploitation.</p>
          <p>The emphasis of this research will be developing waveforms and exploitation algorithms for affordable ISR systems to provide tactical edge in the A2AD/contested environment. We are interested in experimenting proposed waveforms (in hardware) and using these to develop joint SAR and GMTI exploitation algorithms. If implemented successfully, the key benefits to the warfighters will be: (1) transmit signals can hide in adversaries environment but enable ISR objectives and (2) solve the joint SAR and GMTI problem without complexities associated with reconfiguring the radar systems for SAR or GMTI mode. Teaming with a prime contractor is encouraged. No government funded equipment or data will be provided. The contractor will be responsible for the performance evaluation of the waveforms and the exploitation algorithms. No Air Force Research Laboratory facilities will be provided. Government will define the performance parameters. The contractor shall use simulated data (as part of the solution to this research problem) for performance evaluation.</p>
          <p>PHASE I: Research and develop affordable and practical radar waveforms to address contested environment ISR. Using these waveforms, develop signature exploitation concept for concurrent SAR and GMTI for multiple moving and stationary targets detection, geolocation, and tracking. Develop initial technology transition plan and business case analysis.</p>
          <p>PHASE II: Implement (hardware and software) the waveforms and signal processing concepts proposed in Phase I for target detection, geolocation, and tracking of moving targets for contested environments. Develop software toolbox to fully characterize performance bounds of the proposed exploitation algorithms. Refine technology transition plan and business case analysis.</p>
          <p>PHASE III: Qualify and insert proposed technology into an acquisition program.</p>
